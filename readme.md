# prometheus-net.AspNet
A plugin for the [prometheus-net](https://github.com/prometheus-net/prometheus-net) package, exposing ASP.NET full framework metrics. Basic Auth can also be enabled for the endpoint. Can also collect metrics on SQL database calls if using Entity Framework 6.

nuget pack
nuget push movidesk-prometheus-net.AspNet.x.x.x.nupkg personal_github_token -Source github

# Installation

Add the package from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/prometheus-net.AspNet):
>Install-Package: [prometheus-net.AspNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/prometheus-net.AspNet)

If you are using Entity Framework 6 and wish to collect SQL metrics: [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/prometheus-net.EF):
>Install-Package: [prometheus-net.EF](https://www.nuget.org/packages/prometheus-net.EF)

# Usage

To publish your metrics, call `UseMetricsServer` inside your WebApiConfig.Register method, and specify the endpoint. The following code will expose http://localhost/metrics  

```csharp
public static class WebApiConfig
{
    public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
    {
        ...

        PrometheusConfig.UseMetricsServer(config, "metrics");
    }
}
```

If you wish to enable Basic Auth protection for your endpoint, pass through the basic auth username and password when calling `UseMetricsServer`:
```csharp
public static class WebApiConfig
{
    public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
    {
        ...

        PrometheusConfig.UseMetricsServer(config, "metrics", "BasicAuthUsername", "BasicAuthPassword");
    }
}
```

# ASP.NET HTTP request metrics

A HTTP Module is included that exposes some metrics from ASP.NET applications:

* Number of HTTP requests in progress.
* Total number of received HTTP requests.
* Duration of HTTP requests.

To include these metrics edit your `global.asax.cs` and add the following lines:
```csharp
public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
    public static IHttpModule Module = new Prometheus.AspNet.PrometheusHttpRequestModule();

    public override void Init()
    {
        base.Init();
        Module.Init(this);
    }
```

These metrics include labels for HTTP status code (eg, 200), HTTP method (eg, POST), Controller and Action.

# Entity Framework 6 SQL Metrics

A DbCommandInterceptor has been written to track SQL query performance.

To use, add a DbConfigurationType attribute to your DbContext and specify the PrometheusEF6CodeConfig class:

```csharp
[DbConfigurationType("Prometheus.EF.PrometheusEF6CodeConfig, Prometheus.EF")]
public partial class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
	....
}
```

These metrics include SQL timing information and the following labels:

* database - the DB that the query was executed against
* querytype - INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE or DELETE (or empty if not known)
* success - either "true" or "false" indicating query was successful
